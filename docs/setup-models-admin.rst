Setup, Models and Admin
=============================

In this tutorial we will walk through a process of creating an API for a basic poll application. We will be using Python 3.6.x, Django 2.0.x and Django Rest Framework 3.7.x for creating API.

First things first, let's install the required modules within a virtual environment.

.. code-block:: python

    mkvirtualenv pollsapi
    pip install Django
    pip install djangorestframework

Creating a project
--------------------

Earliest in order, to create a project we should move to the directory where we would like to store our code. For this go to command line and use cd command. Then trigger the `startproject` command.

.. code-block:: python

    django-admin startproject pollsapi

This command gives us a 'pollsapi' directory. The contents of this directory looks like this::

    manage.py

    pollsapi/
        __init__.py
        settings.py
        urls.py
        wsgi.py

Database setup
------------------

We will use SQlite database, which is already included with Python. The :code:`pollsapi/settings.py` file woul already have the correct settings.

.. code-block:: python

    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
        }
    }

Now, use the migrate command which builds the needed database tables in regard to the :code:`django_pollsapi/settings.py` file.

.. code-block:: python

    python manage.py migrate


Creating models
---------------------

Before creating our database models, let us create our pollsapi App.

.. code-block:: python

    python manage.py startapp polls

The above command results in a 'polls' directory containing different files::

    admin.py
    apps.py
    models.py
    tests.py
    views.py

Step in to :code:`models.py` file and start writing the models. For creating the polls api we are going to create a :code:`Poll` model, a :code:`Choice` model and a :code:`Vote` model. Once we are done with designing our models, the :code:'models.py' file should look like this:

These models are the same as you would have seen in the Django introduction tutorial.

.. code-block:: python

    from django.db import models
    from django.contrib.auth.models import User


    class Poll(models.Model):
        question = models.CharField(max_length=100)
        created_by = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
        pub_date = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)

        def __str__(self):
            return self.question


    class Choice(models.Model):
        poll = models.ForeignKey(Poll, related_name='choices',on_delete=models.CASCADE)
        choice_text = models.CharField(max_length=100)

        def __str__(self):
            return self.choice_text


    class Vote(models.Model):
        choice = models.ForeignKey(Choice, related_name='votes', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
        poll = models.ForeignKey(Poll, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
        voted_by = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)

        class Meta:
            unique_together = ("poll", "voted_by")


The above models have been designed in such a way that, it would make our API bulding a smooth process.

Activating models
----------------------

With the simple lines of code in the 'models.py' Django can create a database schema and a Python database-access API which has the capability to access the objects of Poll, Choice, Vote. To create the database tables to our models, 'rest_framework' and 'pollsapi' app needs to be added to the "INSTALLED_APPS" in the 'django_pollsapi/settings' file.

.. code-block:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
    ...
    'rest_framework',
    'polls',
    )

Now, run the :code:`makemigrations` command which will notify Django that new models have been created and those changes needs to be applied to the migration. Run :code:`migrate` command to do the actual migration.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python manage.py makemigrations polls

    $ python manage.py migrate



Create an empty :code:`urls.py` in your :code:`polls` app.

.. code-block:: python

    urlpatterns = [
    ]



Go to :code:`pollsapi/urls.py` and include the polls urls.

.. code-block:: python

    urlpatterns = [
        re_path(r'^', include('polls.urls')),
    ]

Now you can runserver ::

    $ python manage.py runserver


Goto any browser of your choice and hit the url :code:`http://127.0.0.1:8000`

And we are in business, with a Django *Congratulations* page greeting us. (Though we haven't added any API endpoints yet.)

We will be adding API endpoints for creating and viewing polls in the next chapter.

Setting up the admin
++++++++++++++++++++++

You should register :code:`Poll` and :code:`Choice` in the admin like this.

.. code-block:: python

    from django.contrib import admin

    from .models import Poll, Choice

    admin.site.register(Poll)
    admin.site.register(Choice)
