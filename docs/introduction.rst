Introductions
=================

*Building APIs with Django and Django Rest Framework* starts where the `Django "Polls" tutorial <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/intro/tutorial01/>`_ stops, and takes you through building the polls app, but this time using APIs. You will learn the basics of Django Rest Framework including serialisation, views, generic views, viewsets, testing, access control. You will also learn about API documentation using swagger and raml.

Who is this book for?
-------------------------

If you have finished the Django "Polls" tuorial, and want to learn using DRF to build APIs, this book is perfect for you. This book assume some knowledge of Django and Python, which you should have built if you have finished the "Poll" tutorial. No existing knowledge of DRF is assumed.


How to read this book?
-------------------------

The chapters are meant to be read in order. If you have existing knowledge of some chapters, you can quickly go throough that chapter, but I highly recommend reading them in order as each chapter builds on the previous.
